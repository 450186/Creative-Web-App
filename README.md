# Creative-Web-App
Final creative web app

## My Proposed Concept

My Proposed concept is a web app that allows the user to mark off on a map of the world where they have been. it will even allow the user to add photos they took during the trip.

## Similar Apps

after extensive research there is a mobile application that is similar called 'Been'. it features a map of the world and you can select places you have been to. this app has features like
how much of the world you've seen and the percentage of each continent they have explored. due to it being a mobile app there is an option to make a widget of it on your IOS device. It also 
features a timeline. The timeline in particular is a feature that I may usee in my web app that I wasn't previously accounting for when I knew I wanted to do this app.

## Approaches I've considered to this app

I have extensive thoughts and laid out a roadmap of all of the features I would like to have in this app. I even had ideas that did not make the final cut due to potential time restraints,
however these could come into play if I believe I do have time come the end of the development. One of these features is not doing it by just country, but doing it by city, because I thought
about how sometimes people go to the same country several times but they go to a different place within the country. A way I can work around this more simply is to allow the user to have some tags on the countries with the cities they visited, and split any photos up into these tags as well. I am going to make sure each user's experience is different to cater for many different audiences. An example of this is how I'm planning on implementing a settings page where the user can say whether they dont like beach holidays or city breaks or hot countries or cold countries etcetera.
I have also considered potentially considering having different views if the user is either a traveller or just interested in going on a holiday and not sure where to go.

## How will I use Data?

Each user will have an account. the data will be stored per user. the data that will be stored will be:
- Places the user has visited
- any preferences the user has 
- the user's wishlist of places they want to visit
- the user's photos from the different places

## How will it present a novel user experience?

In order to present a novel user experience, I had the idea to make it possible to zoom in and out of the world map using hand gestures like pinch and pinch out. There may also be an opportunity to use voice control to find countries rather than typing them into a search bar or finding them on the map. 

## Who is the target audience for this app?

There are 2 main target audiences for my web app. I previously mentioned how I wanted to make to 2 different views depending on whether the user is an avid traveller or just looking for a holiday. These are two target audiences that have different needs from the web app. Someone looking for a holiday is going to have a specific type of holiday in mind, whether that is a beach holiday or a city break or along those lines. A traveller would have different needs such as places with lots of culture, or lots of things to see in the country. They may also want to arrange a travel guide of multiple countries to visit within a certain space of time.
