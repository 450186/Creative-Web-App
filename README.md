# Creative-Web-App
Final creative web app

## My Proposed Concept

My Proposed concept is a web app that allows the user to mark off on a map of the world where they have been. it will even allow the user to add photos they took during the trip.

## Similar Apps

after extensive research there is a mobile application that is similar called 'Been'. it features a map of the world and you can select places you have been to. this app has features like
how much of the world you've seen and the percentage of each continent they have explored. due to it being a mobile app there is an option to make a widget of it on your IOS device. It also 
features a timeline. The timeline in particular is a feature that I may usee in my web app that I wasn't previously accounting for when I knew I wanted to do this app.

## Approaches I've considered to this app

I originally considered recreating ThisIsSand.com to use AI to turn the image of the sand into an AI generated image of some mountains that looked like that piece of art that was created. I decided against this because I quickly became uninterested in it as a project and couldn't really think how I could make it more entertaining for the user. It was one of those ideas that would've got boring for the user very quickly

## How will I use Data?

Each user will have an account. the data will be stored per user. the data that will be stored will be:
- Places the user has visited
- any preferences the user has 
- the user's wishlist of places they want to visit
- the user's photos from the different places

## How will it present a novel user experience?

In order to present a novel user experience, I had the idea to make it possible to zoom in and out of the world map using hand gestures like pinch and pinch out. There may also be an opportunity to use voice control to find countries rather than typing them into a search bar or finding them on the map. 

## Who is the target audience for this app?

There are 2 main target audiences for my web app. I previously mentioned how I wanted to make to 2 different views depending on whether the user is an avid traveller or just looking for a holiday. These are two target audiences that have different needs from the web app. Someone looking for a holiday is going to have a specific type of holiday in mind, whether that is a beach holiday or a city break or along those lines. A traveller would have different needs such as places with lots of culture, or lots of things to see in the country. They may also want to arrange a travel guide of multiple countries to visit within a certain space of time.
